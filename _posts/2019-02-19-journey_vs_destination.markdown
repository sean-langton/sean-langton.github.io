The funny thing about learning how to implement RegEx is that I've been using it for the better part of three years. It's a pretty common way to split out audiences within Google Analytics. Except I never actually took the time to understand what I was using. I knew enough to accompligh the three or four tasks that I needed to accomplish and that was all I ever learned. I can say the same thing about Javascript, VBA, and other software that I would encounter. I was trying to move so fast that I wasn't concerned with actually knowing what I was doing, just trying to build something and learn enough to complete a project I had given myself.

Making an effort to understanding not just the why but the how things are functioning has gone a long way in my developing journey. When I started I would do what I'd always done, which was primarily a guess-and-check system. I'd type some code, run a test, and when it didn't work I would try something else. This was fine in the beginning or when time wasn't a constraint, but quickly the code became too complex or I was spending too much time trying to solve relatively simple problems. I spent exponentially more time trying to the quick & easy route than than properly learn what was going on in the code. Instead of being completely focused on getting to the end product, I take easy step individually. It's amazing to me how much quicker I'm able to solve problems when instead of assuming what the problem is, I take "extra" time to dive-in and see where the issue actually is. 

This is just the first on many skills I've taken from learning web development and tried to apply to other aspects of my life. I'm trying to focus less on where I think I should be, where I think others are, where I think I could have been if I had done things differently. By being less worried about what my goal is and more focused on what I can do today to try and get there, I spend far more time taking action as opposed to making plans that are likely to change or wasting time worrying about things that are outside my control.
