This is definetly the project that I spent the most amount of time thinking about, most amount of time spent from start to completion, and least amount of time spent writing actual code. Which is funny because it's the language that I thought I was the most comfortable with coming into Flatiron. I had done something things with Google Scripts and VBA, which both have a lot of similarities with Javascript. But something about getting into scope and jquery and everything that was being thrown at me in the lessons with minimal labs made me feel like I had no idea what I was doing. I spent a day and half confused by coffeescript being the default rails language and how to switch back to javascript.

I think where I got hung-up the most is that I just had a hard time readying javascript. Especially when using jquery, I just had a hard time looking at Javascript and knowing what what happening. But after working on the project, I feel a lot more comfortable with the various nuances of Javascript. I understand WHY functions have to wait until the page loads. I understand the similarities between "function ()" and "() ->". Going through the lessions I was either just relying on information from other sources to get through it or trying to compare javascript to a ruby equilivent. After the project I feel l'm doing a better job of just writing Javascript.

The output of the project itself I don't feel great about. I didn't particularly add a ton of functionality and in some cases I think it actually functions worse than the original version. I definetly have a general understanding of why javascript is important in developing web applications and being able to load information without reloading the page is important, but I don't feel like this project presents a good example of this. I think the tic-tac-toe game was actually a better example of a web app that was better executed with the addition of javascript.
