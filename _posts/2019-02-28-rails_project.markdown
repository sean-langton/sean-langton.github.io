Going through the walkthrough for my rails project felt a bit like on Parks and Recreation when [Ben presented his stop-motion film.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jqKiVHS6x4) What I had spent 4 very solid days on I was able to walk through in about 4 minutes. It definetly felt like I had built something bigger while I was creating it. I think it's likely due to the amount of time spent working on backend items, layers of authentication to prevent unathorized access or controls to parts of the program. Until developing something on my own I didn't full appreciate just how much time and effort went into preventing users from doing things you don't want them to do compared to the planned use cases.

As I continuing on this path, I'm definetly getting better when it comes to planning out execution before hand. There were still changes made to planned architecture as I developed but there were fewer this project than the others, and given the increased scale of this project that's something I'm proud of. There was also the continued pattern of starting out by often copying examples from previously completed labs before eventually getting my legs under me and thinking on my own. Particularly when it came to the utilization of class and helper methods, I really felt like I went from barely understanding their use to coming up with solutions and improvements on my own over the week working on this project.

Overall, it's nice to finally start building things than look and feel like actually web applications. It's also nice to take something that's been a running job between a group of co-workers for two years and start turning it into a reality. As with my Sinatra project this is not much more than a stub of something I'm looking to continue developing and my skills and knowledge base improve.
