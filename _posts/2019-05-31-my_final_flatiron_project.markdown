This is the most time I've spent on actively developing a project and correspondingly the best I've felt going into a review. It's far from perfect and there's a couple UI bugs that I still hope to iron out, but for the first time I built something that actually looks a bit like a real web application. It's a good sense of accomplishment to build something that I actually look forward to continuing to develop. I think I can build something that people may actually use within a couple weeks, and there were times where that did not feel like it was ever gonna be possible.

Coming out of the Javascript project I wasn't sure how well I was going to do as things became more complicated. This project also felt like the lessons did not cover requirements as in-depth as the previous project. But now that I'm on the other side of this I think it was honestly for the best. It took me almost a full week longer to complete the project than I would have liked but I feel like I finally have a handle on how data is passed between state and components through props. There's definetly features I want to add in the future but I'll look to gain a better holistic understanding of React first. In working on this there's definetly packages I want to learn more about that I think will make things more fluid moving forward. 

The biggest surprise to me working on this is just how easy Bootstrap makes it to have an app that looks very modern and stylish. My biggest concern about being a "Full-Stack Web Developer" is my sense of design is lacking. My biggest area of improvement would be to learn about the science behind user interfaces and how to make an application that's both full-featured and intuitive. But for now I'm happy with just plugging in the default Bootstrap components and focusing on building a better technical understanding.
