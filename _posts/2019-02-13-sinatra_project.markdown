My second solo project defintely went better than the first. Instead of trying to fit structures of existing labs into what I trying to do, I thought about what I wanted to do first and relied on my ability to develop that. Spent far more time thinking about how to code something myself as oppose to trying to find old code or concepts that I could reuse, and I believe that made me far more efficent this time around. There were still situations where I removed or adjusted features because they were either redudant or would require too much time to deelop without being a required feature of the product. My ambition for what I want to develop is still overreaching my current skill level, but I don't believe that's a bad thing.

A skill I feel I developed significantly on this project is resolving bugs. Previously when encountering a bug I would simply try to "guess and check" my way out of the situation as oppose to trying understanding what was causing the problem. I wasted a lot of time "fixing" things where there was nothing wrong. Getting well acquainted with binding.pry and tux has both increased the speed in which I solve problems and my understanding of how the actual software is working.

It's nice to finally be developing programs that actually look and feel like programs. I struggled for so long learning to code because I could never grasp how "Hello World" eventually turned into building a full-functioning product. Now that I'm here it's exciting that I'll soon be able to develop software and websites that provide real value and solve problems.
